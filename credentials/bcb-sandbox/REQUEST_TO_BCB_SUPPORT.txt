Subject: Request for Sandbox API Credentials (Alternative to GPG File)

Hello BCB Support Team,

I received the sandbox credentials file "Sandbox_credentials.api (4).gpg" encrypted with GPG.

Unfortunately, I cannot decrypt this file as I don't remember the passphrase for my GPG key (admin@bitflow.biz).

Could you please provide the sandbox API credentials in one of the following ways:

**Option 1:** Send credentials via BCB Portal (secure message/download)
**Option 2:** Send an unencrypted file to my registered email
**Option 3:** Re-encrypt the file using a new GPG key I will provide

I need the following credentials to test the Virtual IBAN integration:
- Client ID (OAuth)
- Client Secret (OAuth)
- Counterparty ID
- CID
- API URL (sandbox)
- GPG keys (if required for API requests)

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,
Bogdan Kononenko
