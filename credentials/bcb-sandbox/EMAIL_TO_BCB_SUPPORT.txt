Subject: Re: Sandbox Credentials - Unable to Decrypt GPG File

Hello BCB Support Team,

Thank you for confirming that the client_id and client_secret are in the encrypted file.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to decrypt the file "Sandbox_credentials.api (4).gpg" because I don't remember the passphrase for my GPG key (admin@bitflow.biz).

Could you please help me with one of the following options:

**Option 1 (Preferred):** Send the sandbox credentials via BCB Portal as a secure download or message (without GPG encryption)

**Option 2:** I can create a new GPG key and send you the public key for re-encryption

I need these credentials to complete the Virtual IBAN integration testing:
- OAuth Client ID
- OAuth Client Secret  
- Counterparty ID
- CID
- API URL (sandbox)

I apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your help!

Best regards,
